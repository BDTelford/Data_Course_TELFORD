1. What other stuff does read.csv() do automatically? Separates the values by commas. dec = "." which denotes that a period means a decimal point in the file.  fill is automatically true which means that in case the rows have unequal length, blank fields are implicitly added. 

2. How is it different from read.csv2()? read.csv2() separates values using a semi colon sep = ";"

3. Why does read.csv2() even exist? for countries that use a comma as decimal point and a semicolon as field separator.
4. How could I change the parameters of read.csv() to make it so the class of the “State”
column is “character” instead of “factor?” you can change the parameters for calling the columns per individual column see following code: df <- read.csv("../../Data/landdata-states.csv", colClasses=c("State"="character")) 
5. What command would give the summary stats for ONLY the Home.Value column? summary(df$Home.Value)

6. What value is returned by the command: names(df)[4] ? [1] "Home.Value"
7. What is happening when you add (. . . col=df$region) to the above plotting code? The plot is now colored by region
